                    <p>
                    You know how the genesis Binkies collection said they are hopping around and banging on the mainnet?
                    Well... some Binkies weren't playing it very safe and now have <strong>Binkie Babies</strong>, a collection of 3,333
                    babies trying to find their parents on the mainnet.
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                    We reduced the amount of traits to really bring out the cuteness in our colleciton of Binkie Babies. but other than the cute
                    faces we left all the other traits so you can find your Binkies offspring! (Or get another chance to pull a SUPER RARE)
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                    We are working directly with the Binkies founders to make sure that this collection follows the high standards that Binkies 
                    genesis collection has set. This generation of Binkies will be a huge advocate to how awesome BinkieVille and Binkie Academy is!
                    </p>
